Speaker Diarization pipeline based on OpenAI Whisper
I'd like to thank [@m-bain](https://github.com/m-bain) for Wav2Vec2 forced alignment, [@mu4farooqi](https://github.com/mu4farooqi) for punctuation realignment algorithm

This work is based on [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) , [Nvidia NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) , and [Facebook's Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs)

## What is it
This repository combines Whisper ASR capabilities with Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Speaker Embedding to identify the speaker for each sentence in the transcription generated by Whisper. First, the vocals are extracted from the audio to increase the speaker embedding accuracy, then the transcription is generated using Whisper, then the timestamps are corrected and aligned using WhisperX to help minimize diarization error due to time shift. The audio is then passed into MarbleNet for VAD and segmentation to exclude silences, TitaNet is then used to extract speaker embeddings to identify the speaker for each segment, the result is then associated with the timestamps generated by WhisperX to detect the speaker for each word based on timestamps and then realigned using punctuation models to compensate for minor time shifts.


Whisper, WhisperX and NeMo parameters are coded into diarize.py and helpers.py, I will add the CLI arguments to change them later

## Usage 

```
python diarize.py -a AUDIO_FILE_NAME
```

## Command Line Options

- `-a AUDIO_FILE_NAME`: The name of the audio file to be processed
- `--no-stem`: Disables source separation
- `--whisper-model`: The model to be used for ASR, default is `medium.en`

## Known Limitations
- Only tested on english but several other languages are supported
- Overlapping speakers are yet to be addressed, a possible approach would be to separate the audio file and isolate only one speaker, then feed it into the pipeline but this will need much more computation
- There might be some errors, please raise an issue if you encounter any.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a maximum length per sentence for SRT
- Use Whisper word-level timestamps for languages that are not in WhisperX
- Improve performance using Faster Whisper or Batched Inference

## Aknowledgements
Special Thanks for [@adamjonas](https://github.com/adamjonas) for supporting this project
